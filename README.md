That's a great list of additional features you can add to your project! Here are some thoughts on how you could prioritize and implement them:

Essential Features for Basic Functionality:

User Authentication (Enhanced): Focus on robust password hashing, secure login sessions with JWTs, and consider adding features like social login (e.g., Google, Facebook) and password reset functionality.
Expense Management (Enhanced): Implement user-specific expense categorization, tagging, and filtering options. Allow users to export expense data in different formats (CSV, PDF).
Security Enhancements: Regularly update dependencies with security patches. Implement rate limiting and input validation on all API endpoints. Consider security headers (e.g., HSTS, Content Security Policy) for additional protection.
Optional Features for Improved User Experience:

Shopping Cart & Checkout: Implement a user-friendly shopping cart experience. Integrate a payment gateway for secure transactions.
Product Management: Add product categories, filtering, and sorting options. Allow for product image galleries and detailed descriptions.
Search Functionality: Implement a search bar with autocomplete or suggestions based on user input.
Advanced Features:

Wishlist & Order History: Allow users to add products to a wishlist and view their past orders.
Inventory Management: Track product stock levels and display real-time availability.
Responsive Design: Ensure the website adapts seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes.
Promotions & Discounts: Implement coupon codes, flash sales, and other promotional strategies.
Email Notifications: Send automated emails for order confirmations, shipping updates, and abandoned carts.
Advanced Admin Features: Provide detailed reporting for sales, user activity, and inventory management. Allow for bulk product import and management tools.
SEO Optimization: Optimize website content and structure for better search engine rankings.
Prioritization:

Consider your project's core objectives and target audience when prioritizing features. Start with essential functionalities that provide a solid foundation for your application. Once the core functionality is established, you can gradually add features based on user feedback and market demands.

Implementation Tips:

Break down complex features into smaller, manageable tasks.
Utilize libraries and frameworks to expedite development (e.g., Mongoose for data modeling, Stripe for payment processing).
Thoroughly test each feature before deployment.
Continuously monitor your application and address any security vulnerabilities.
